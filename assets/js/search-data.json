EMPLOYEE’S NAME (printed): ___________________ . EMPLOYEE’S SIGNATURE: _________________ . DATE: ____________ . Back to the top . Mission and Values . Build Oahu specializes in kitchens, bathrooms, additions and large renovations. . From start to finish, we do our job as quickly, efficiently and as clean as possible. . No job is too small for our customers because we know if we’re there for them to fix something small, they will want us to help them when they take on a larger project. . Our motto is design and build. We walk with our customers through each phase of the design, permit and construction process, because helping them when they need us creates less stress and leads to the high-quality homes they have always dreamed of. . Back to the top . Employee Conduct . Hours of Operation . The normal hours of operation for all employees are from 7:30 am to 4:00 pm, Monday through Friday. We expect you to be at the jobsite or working as directed at the beginning of your shift and stay on the clock until the end of the workday or the end of your shift. In general, this requires that you arrive at the job site about 15 minutes early to park, unload any tools, get focused and be prepared to start work. . Earlier or later hours may be required at times and there may be coordination calls that need to occur prior to or after your shift. The possibility of working overtime above scheduled hours (including weekend hours) will always be present and considered mandatory when the workload is excessive. For more information on overtime hours see the section of this handbook on overtime. . Back to the top . Attendance and Punctuality . We expect Build Oahu employees to arrive at work before you are scheduled to start and be productively engaged in the company business by the scheduled start time. If you cannot come to work or you will be late, you must notify your Supervisor prior to your scheduled start time, unless in extenuating circumstances. You must request all time off in advance and submit it in writing, as outlined in this section and the section on Leave, except in the case of an unexpected illness. . Unplanned absences can disrupt work, inconvenience other employees, and affect productivity. All unapproved absences will be noted in the employee’s personnel file. Excessive absences (including leaving work early) or tardiness, including for illness or personal reasons, will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination. . Back to the top . Recording Your Time . All Build Oahu employees are given a key fob they use to clock in and out of each job site using a system called TSheets. It is mandatory that you clock in and clock out of the specific jobsite where you are located, including clocking in and out for lunch. If you leave the facility or job site for non‐business reasons you must clock out. Failure to do any of the above will result in disciplinary action up to and including termination and possible discrepancies in the amount of your compensation. . Back to the top . Customer Contact . Treat all customers with utmost respect. Keep customer interactions brief, polite and professional. Avoid cursing or speaking loudly. Remember that we are working in our customers homes. Keep all work areas clean and organized at all times and do not track dirt and debris between work areas. . Any customer-related problems, including customers who are abusive or harassing, should be reported to your supervisor. . Back to the top . Appearance . Employees must appear clean and neat and wear company shirts when working. We provide each employee with 5 company shirts when hired. If an employee works for less than 6 months then he/she must return the shirts in good condition or a cost of 65 dollars will be taken from his/her last paycheck. There is no charge for employees who have worked for longer than 6 months. . Unpleasant body odors which are a result of lack of hygience should be avoided and could result in dismissal because they affect an employees ability to interact with customers and co-workers in a professional manner. .

Tool belt | Hammer | Nail puller | Razor knife | Screwdrivers | Crescent wrench | Pliers | Drywall knife | Torpedo level | Speed square | Tape measure | Pencil | . Employees are also expected to own the standard safety equipment below: . Hard hat | Steel-toed boots / foot protection | Ear protection | Eye and face protection | Dust mask/ respiratory protection | Gloves | First aid kit | . These items are not required in order to be eligible for employment. There is a 60 day grace period for the employee to purchase the requisite items; however, if an employee is still borrowing tools and safety equipment from coworkers or their supervisor after 60 days then it may be considered an indication the employee is not able to fullfil the responsibilities of his/her position. . Build Oahu will provide specialized equipment, such as table saw, chop saw, compressor and nail guns, chipping guns and grinders. We will also provide any unique, or specialized safety equipment in the event that a job requires more than the standard items listed above. . Work Rules . We expect you to follow certain work rules and conduct yourself in ways that protect the interests and safety of all employees and Build Oahu. . These rules are published for your information and to minimize the likelihood of any employee, through misunderstanding or otherwise, to become subject to any disciplinary action. . Violation of work rules such as these as well as other offenses deemed appropriate by management may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment: . Theft or inappropriate removal or possession of property | Falsification of timekeeping or other company records | Working under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs | Possession, distribution, sale, transfer, or use of alcohol or illegal drugs in the workplace, while on duty, or while operating employer-owned vehicles or equipment | Conviction of a felony | Fighting or threatening violence in the workplace | Boisterous or disruptive activity in the workplace | Negligence or improper conduct leading to damage of employer-owned or customer-owned property | Insubordination or other disrespectful conduct | Sleeping during work hours | Violation of safety or health rules | Smoking in prohibited areas | Sexual or other unlawful or unwelcome harassment | Possession of dangerous or unauthorized materials, such as explosives or firearms, in the workplace | Contributing to unsanitary conditions, poor housekeeping or eating at workstations | Excessive absenteeism or any absence without notice | Absence for three consecutive work days without notification (except in extenuating circumstances) | Unauthorized absence from work during the workday | Unauthorized use of telephones, mail system, or other employer-owned equipment | Unauthorized disclosure of business “secrets” or confidential information | Unauthorized presence on Company property outside of employee’s scheduled work hours | Violation of personnel policies | Unsatisfactory performance or conduct | . This list is an example only and is not all-inclusive. . Since your employment with Build Oahu is voluntary and at will, you may terminate your employment at any time you want, with or without cause or advance notice. Likewise, Build Oahu may terminate your employment at any time, with or without cause or advance notice. . Back to the top . Drug and Alcohol Use . Employees may not use, possess, distribute, sell, or be under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs while while conducting any business-related activity. . You are required to come to work in a mental and physical condition that will allow you to perform your job satisfactorily. You may use legally prescribed drugs on the job only if they do not impair your ability to perform the essential functions of your job effectively and safely without endangering yourself or others. . In the event of a job-related accident, drug testing may be required. Also, we may perform testing for additional reasons which include, but are not limited to pre-employment, suspicious behavior and/or random selection. . If you violate this policy, it may lead to disciplinary action, up to and including immediate termination of your employment. If you violate this policy, there could also be legal consequences. . Back to the top . Wages and Benefits . Pay Date . The workweek for payroll purposes starts on Friday and ends the following Thursday. The pay period is weekly, meaning you will receive payment for one work week at a time. The pay date is the second Friday after the pay period ends. For example, the pay date of Friday October 25, 2019 covers the period of Friday October 11, 2019 through Thursday October 17, 2019. Payday is every Friday through direct deposit only. The pay date will not be adjusted for any reasons, to include scheduled vacations. . Your pay statement will be emailed to you at the email address you provide, and will list your gross pay and itemized deductions for all time worked through the preceding payroll week. If you discover a mistake on your pay statement, notify your supervisor as soon as you notice the mistake. . Back to the top . Overtime . Overtime work must be approved in advance by the Owner. On occasion, Build Oahu employees must work overtime in order to achieve the quality of work for our customers that reflects our mission and values. If directed, you are expected to work necessary overtime during these occasions. Full-time employees will receive time and one‐half pay for time worked exceeding 40 hours in any given workweek. Temporary employees do not receive overtime. . There may be operations that require you to work at night. Work outside of normal work hours does not automatically qualify as overtime pay. If you are asked to work at night, but your total hours worked for that workweek is less than or equal to 40 hours you will not receive overtime pay. . Your supervisor will inform you of the need to work overtime hours in a timely manner with as much lead time as possible. . Back to the top . Rest and Lunch Breaks . It is our policy to provide two 10‐minute rest breaks and a 30-minute lunch break during the course of each full workday. Usually you may take one break in the morning and one in the afternoon, but your supervisor may change the frequency and time of rest breaks if necessary. Time spent on your 10‐minute breaks will be compensated as working time. Normal break times are scheduled around 10:00 am and 3:00 pm. . Normal lunch breaks are scheduled between the hours of 11:00 am – 2:00 pm. You will have 30 minutes for a lunch break each day. Since mealtime is not part of your working hours, you are not paid for it. . Rest breaks and lunch breaks cannot be scheduled to accommodate appointments, late arrivals or early departures. You are expected to be punctual in starting and ending your breaks and lunch hours and may be disciplined for tardiness. If you choose to remain at work during your break, you are not entitled to arrive later than the scheduled starting time or leave before the normal quitting time and will not receive extra pay for the time worked. . Back to the top . Health Insurance . Build Oahu provides individual medical, dental and vision health care plans to all full-time employees at no additional cost to the employee. .

At this time Build Oahu does not provide any accrued paid time off, such as vacation or sick leave to our employees. . You are free to take unpaid time off for reasons like vacation, medical appointments, personal or family reasons, or illness provided your absences are well coordinated with your supervisor and the time spent away from work or the number of occurances does not result in excessive absence as outlined in the section on Attendance and Punctuality .

Vacation days should be requested a minimum of two weeks in advance.

We must also pay Social Security Tax in an amount equal to that being deducted from your paycheck, up to a maximum set by law. Management will honor any court‐ordered or other legally authorized wage garnishment.

You may, of course, request information on this subject at any time prior to actual separation. . Back to the top . Workers’ Compensation . Build Oahu provides a workers’ compensation insurance program to employees which may cover you if you are injured on the job. This program does not cost you anything. . The workers’ compensation program covers injuries or illnesses that require medical, surgical, or hospital treatment. Subject to legal requirements, workers’ compensation insurance begins after a short waiting period, or if you are hospitalized, the benefits begin immediately. . Workers’ compensation covers only work-related injuries and illnesses. Neither the Company nor its insurance carrier will pay workers’ compensation benefits for injuries that might happen if you voluntarily participate in an off-duty recreational, social, or athletic activity that we might sponsor. . It is your responsibility to immediately notify your supervisor and the Owner, James Kijek on the day of the incident of any injuries you sustain while on the job. It is very important that you tell your supervisor immediately about any work-related injury or illness, regardless of how minor it might seem at the time. Prompt reporting helps to make sure that you qualify for coverage as quickly as possible and allows us to investigate the matter promptly. . Back to the top . Safety Program . Build Oahu Safety Policy . Build Oahu places a high value on the safety of its employees, and we are committed to providing a safe workplace for all employees. We have developed this program for injury prevention to involve management, supervisors, and employees in identifying and eliminating hazards that may develop during our work process. . It is the basic safety policy of this company that no task is so important that an employee must violate a safety rule or take a risk of injury or illness in order to get the job done. Employees are required to comply with all company safety rules and are encouraged to actively participate in identifying ways to make our company a safer place to work. . Supervisors, also called project leads, are responsible for the safety of their employees and as a part of their daily duties must check the workplace for unsafe conditions, watch employees for unsafe actions and take prompt action to eliminate any hazards. . Management will do its part by devoting the resources necessary to develop and maintain a system for identifying and correcting hazards; plan for foreseeable emergencies; provide initial and ongoing training for employees and supervisors, and we will establish a disciplinary policy to ensure that company safety policies are followed. . Safety is a team effort – Let us all work together to keep this a safe and healthy workplace . Back to the top . Safety and Healthy Responsibilities . Safety is a team effort. Each member of Build Oahu has a role to play to maintain a safe working environment. . Owner responsibilities: . Ensure employees have opportunity to discuss safety observations and request improvements in a group setting on a monthly basis. | Ensure the observations and improvements identified during safety meetings are implemented. | Ensure that sufficient employee time, supervisor support, and funds are budgeted for safety equipment, training and to carry out the safety program. | Evaluate supervisors each year to make sure they are carrying out their safety responsibilities. | Ensure that incidents are fully investigated and corrective action taken to prevent the hazardous conditions or behaviors from happening again. | Ensure that a record of injuries and work-related illnesses is maintained and posted as described in this program. | Set a good example by following established safety rules and attending required training. | Report unsafe practices or conditions to the supervisor of the area where the hazard was observed. | Ensure that new employees receive an initial briefing on the content of this safety section program and their responsibilities within this safety program. | . Supervisor responsibilities: . Ensure that each employee you supervise on the job site has received an initial orientation before beginning work. | Ensure that each employee you supervise on the job site is competent or receives training on safe operation of equipment or tasks before starting work on that equipment or project. | Ensure that each employee has the required personal protective equipment (PPE) before starting work on a project requiring PPE. | Do a daily walk-around safety-check of the work area.

Back to the top . Disciplinary Policy . Employees are expected to use good judgment when doing their work and to follow established safety rules. We have established a disciplinary policy to provide appropriate consequences for failure to follow safety rules. This policy is designed not so much to punish as to bring unacceptable behavior to the employee’s attention in a way that the employee will be motivated to make corrections. The following consequences apply to the violation of the same rule or the same unacceptable behavior: . First Instance – verbal warning, notation in employee file, and instruction on proper actions Second Instance – 1 day suspension, written reprimand, and instruction on proper actions Third Instance – 1 week suspension, written reprimand, and instruction on proper actions Fourth Instance – Termination of employment. . An employee may be subject to immediate termination when a safety violation places the employee or co-workers at risk of permanent disability or death. . Back to the top . Employee Safety Meetings . All employees are required to regularly attend monthly safety meetings held on the last Friday each month at the Shop. This meeting is to help identify safety problems, develop solutions, review incidents and reports, provide training and evaluate the effectiveness of our safety program. . Back to the top . Incident Reporting and Record Keeping . Employees are required to report any injury or work related illness to their immediate supervisor regardless of how serious. The employee will send an email to James Kijek summarizing the injury/illness and how it happened. The subject of the email should say “Employee Injury/Illness Report”. . James Kijek will: . Determine from the Employee’s Report or any workers’ compensation claim form associated with the incident, whether it must be recorded on the OSHA Form 300 Log of Work-Related Injuries and Illnesses and Summary according to the instructions for that form. | Enter a recordable incident onto OSHA Form 300 within seven days after the company becomes aware of it. | Investigate recordable incidents using procedures in the Incident Investigation Procedure section below. | If the injury is not recorded on the OSHA log, add it to the incident log, which is used to record non-OSHA recordable injuries and near misses. | Each month at the scheduled safety committee meeting, make any new injury reports and investigations available for review, along with an updated OSHA and incident report log. | Should multiple accidents occur at the workplace an analysis shall be done at least semi-annually to identify trends. i.e. back injuries, slips, trips, and falls, etc. Identification of the types, causes and nature of accidents and injuries occurring as well as which job tasks these accidents are occurring will help to focus on what area(s) need corrective action. In addition, the trend analysis shall be performed as a result of departmental, job site or other work areas where Hazard Recognition Survey/Inspections are performed. This will assist in identifying unsafe conditions and other hazardous situations that may be occurring on a consistent basis. | . At the end of each year, James Kijek will use OSHA Form 300 to complete OSHA Form 300a Summary of Work-Related Injuries and Illnesses. James Kijek will post a signed copy of the OSHA log summary for the previous year on the bulletin board at the shop each February 1 until April 30. OSHA Form 300’s will be kept on file for at least 5 years. Any employee can view an OSHA Form 300’s and 300a’s upon request at any time during the year. . The following types of incidents must be reported to the Hawai’i Occupational Safety and Health Division (HIOSH) and must be recorded in OSHA Form 300: . If an employee dies while working or is not expected to survive, when one (1) or more employee are admitted to a hospital as a result of a work-related incident, amputation and loss of an eye, James Kijek will contact HIOSH within 8 hours after becoming aware of the incident at 808-586-9102. Also, if an accident results in more than $25,000 in property damage James Kijek will contact the Hawai’i Occupational Safety and Health Division (HIOSH) within 8 hours after becoming aware of the incident. . When an incident matching the criteria explained occurs, James Kijek must talk with a representative of HIOSH. During evenings and weekends, a message can be left on the answering machine. James Kijek must report: the employer name, location and time of the incident, number of employees involved, the extent of injuries or illness, a brief description of what happened and the name and phone number of a contact person. These types of incidents must also be recorded on Occupational Health and Safety (OSHA) form 300. . The following types of incidents must be recorded on OSHA Form 300 but DO NOT NEED to be reported to the Hawai’i Occupational Safety and Health Division (HIOSH): . Any work-related injury that results in a fatality, days away from work, job restriction or transfer, or medical treatment beyond first aid. Note that trips to the Emergency Room, or diagnostic procedures such as x-rays, do not automatically qualify as treatement beyond first aid. A medical treatment such as prescription medications, sutures, etc. would need to be provided in order to qualify. . Any incident included in the OSHA form 300, or any injury that could have resulted in serious injury (near-miss) will be investigated using the Incident Investigation Procedure below. . Back to the top . Incident Investigation Procedure . Whenever there is an incident that requires HIOSH to be notified, a preliminary investigation will be conducted by the immediate supervisor of the injured person(s), James Kijek, and any other persons whose expertise would help the investigation. . • DO NOT DISTURB the scene except to aid in rescue or make the scene safe. . The investigation team will take written statements from witnesses, photograph the incident scene and equipment involved. The team will also document as soon as possible after the incident, the condition of equipment and any anything else in the work area that may be relevant. The team will make a written “Incident Investigation Report” of its findings. The report will include a sequence of events leading up to the incident, conclusions about the incident and any recommendations to prevent a similar incident in the future. The report will be reviewed by all employees at the next safety meeting. . When James Kijek or a supervisor becomes aware of an employee injury which must be recorded in OSHA Form 300, but was not serious enough to require that HIOSH be notified, the supervisor will write a narrative summary of the incident, attempt to explain why the incident happened and provide recommendations to prevent a similar incident in the future. Then, the supervisor will paste in or attach the text to an email with the subject “Incident Investigation Report” and send the email to James Kijek. These reports and others will be kept in a folder titled “Incident Log”. . Whenever there is an incident that did not but could have resulted in serious injury to an employee (a near-miss), the incident will be investigated by the supervisor or a team depending on the seriousness of the injury that would have occurred. The resulting report will be clearly marked to indicate that it was a near miss and that no actual injury occurred and the report will be to the Incident Log. . Back to the top . Eliminating Workplace Hazards . Build Oahu is committed to eliminating or controlling workplace hazards that could cause injury or illness to our employees. We will meet the requirements of state safety standards where there are specific rules about a hazard or potential hazard in our workplace. In addition to reviewing injury records and investigating incidents for their causes, we will regularly check the workplace for hazards as described below: . Whenever possible we will organize our operations to eliminate employee exposure to hazards. If operational or engineering controls are not possible, we will write work rules that effectively prevent employee exposure to the hazard. When the above methods of control are not possible or are not fully effective we will require employees to use personal protective equipment (PPE) such as safety glasses, hearing protection, foot protection etc. . Basic Safety Rules . The following basic safety rules have been established to help make our company a safe and efficient place to work. These rules are in addition to safety rules that must be followed when doing particular jobs or operating certain equipment. Those rules are listed elsewhere in this program. Failure to comply with these rules will result in disciplinary action. . Never do anything that is unsafe in order to get the job done. If a job is unsafe, report it to your supervisor or safety committee representative. We will find a safer way to do that job. | Do not remove or disable any safety device! Keep guards in place at all times on operating machinery. • Never operate a piece of equipment unless you have been trained and are authorized. • Use your personal protective equipment whenever it is required. | Obey all safety warning signs. | Working under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs or using them at work is prohibited. • Do not bring firearms or explosives onto company property. | Smoking is only permitted outside the building away from any entry or ventilation intake. | Horseplay, running and fighting are prohibited | Clean up spills immediately. Replace all tools and supplies after use. Do not allow scraps to accumulate where they will become a hazard. Good housekeeping helps prevent injuries | . Back to the top . Employment Policies .

The provisions in the handbook have been developed at the discretion of management and, except for the policy of employment-at-will, may be amended or cancelled at any time, at the sole discretion of the Company. . These provisions replace all other existing policies and practices and may not be changed or added to without the express written approval of the chief executive officer of the Company. . Back to the top . Evaluation Period of Employment . The first 60 calendar days of full-time employment is an evaluation period for new and rehired employees. During this evaluation period, we will evaluate your work habits and abilities to make sure that you can perform your job satisfactorily. The evaluation period also gives you time to decide if the new job meets your expectations. . If you are absent for a significant amount of time during your evaluation period, the length of the absence will automatically extend the evaluation period. We may also extend the evaluation period if we decide it was not long enough to evaluate your performance. This could happen either during or at the end of the introductory period. . You and your immediate supervisor share the responsibility for your performance and the further development of your skills. Therefore, please do not hesitate to discuss any aspect of your job with your supervisor. Communication is key. If you don’t know, then ask. If you are not comfortable doing something then don’t do it. Ask for help. You are not expected to know how to do everything you are asked to do during your evaluation period, but we do expect you to display a willingness and ability to learn how. . After you have been employed for 60 days, you will be reviewed by your supervisor. If you have satisfactorily completed the evaluation period, you will be classified as a regular employee and will receive an initial pay increase based on the results of your evaluation. For more information on these and other benefits you receive as an employee of Build Oahu please read the Benefits Section . Employment both before and after the evaluation period is at-will, you or the company may terminate your employment at any time, with or without cause or advance notice. . Back to the top . Performance Appraisals . An employee and his/her supervisor should discuss job performance and goals on an informal, day-to-day basis. In addition, supervisors will schedule a meeting with you on or around January 31 and August 1 of each year to discuss your work and goals, identify and correct areas for improvement, and to encourage and recognize your strengths. . Information derived from the appraisal may be considered when making decisions affecting training, pay, promotion, transfer, or continued employment. Performance evaluations are not automatically tied to pay increases. . Back to the top . Drug Testing . There can be serious safety and health risks if an employee uses or is under the influence of drugs on the job. . All job applicants are required to pass a drug test to be considered eligible for employment. We may also ask employees to provide body substance samples, such as urine and/or blood, post-accident, randomly or for suspicious behavior. We will use the samples to check for the illegal or illicit use of drugs. If you refuse to be tested for drugs, you may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. . Back to the top . Equal Employment Opportunity . Build Oahu is an equal employment opportunity employer. We maintain a policy of non‐discrimination against employees or job applicants on the basis of race, religion, color, sex, age, national origin, handicap, military status, disability or any other status or characteristic protected by applicable state laws, except where a bona fide occupational qualification applies. . We will recruit, hire, train and promote persons in all job classifications. Furthermore, we insure that all personnel programs such as compensation, benefits, transfers, layoffs, return from layoff, company‐sponsored training, and social and recreation programs will be administered without regard to race, religion, color, sex, age, national origin, handicap, veteran status, or any other status of condition protected by applicable state law. . If you have a question about any type of discrimination at work, talk with your immediate supervisor the Operations Manager or the Owner. You will not be punished for asking questions about this. Also, if we find out that anyone was illegally discriminating, that person will be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. . Back to the top . Disability Accommodation . It is the policy of Build Oahu to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and The ADA Amendments Act of 2008. . We will make sure that all individuals with disabilities: . Have an equal opportunity to apply for jobs and to work in jobs for which they are qualified; | Have an equal opportunity to be promoted once they are working; | Have equal access to benefits and privileges of employment that are offered to other employees; and | Are not harassed because of their disability. | . We will not ask questions about disabilities or require medical examinations until after we have made someone a conditional job offer. We keep medical records confidential and separate from other personnel files. After making a job offer, we will only ask disability-related questions and conduct medical examinations for everyone in the same job category. . Once a person with a disability has started working, actual job performance, and not the employee’s disability, will be used as an indicator of the employee’s ability to do the job. Any medical information about applicants or employees will be kept confidential. Information can be confidential even if it contains no medical diagnosis or treatment course and even if it is not generated by a health care professional. . We will provide reasonable accommodations if a person with a disability needs one in order to apply for a job, perform a job, or enjoy benefits equal to those we offer to other employees. We will not provide an accommodation that poses an undue hardship to Build Oahu. . Once an accommodation is requested, we will discuss the employee’s needs and identify the appropriate reasonable accommodation. We may ask for documentation as to why the requested accommodation is needed. We will ask questions related to disability and may require a medical examination of an employee whose medical condition appears to be causing performance or safety problems. . ADA (Life-Threatening Illnesses in the Workplace) . Employees with serious illnesses or injury often wish to continue their normal lives, including work, to the degree that they can. Build Oahu wants to help these employees to work as long as they continue meeting acceptable performance standards. As with other disabilities, we will offer you reasonable accommodations to let you perform the essential functions of your position as long as it doesn’t cause undue hardship to Build Oahu. . Build Oahu also prohibits discrimination or harassment against individuals with a serious illness or injury. Employees are prohibited from any actions or behavior intended to draw attention to, harass or discriminate against an individual with a serious illness or injury. . You do not have to discuss your serious illness or injury with anyone unless you choose to do so. If you decide to inform your supervisor or the Human Resources Department about your situation, any information that you disclose will be held in the greatest confidence. All employees are prohibited from disclosing the personal health information of another employee. Any medical information which we receive will be kept confidential. . If you are hospitalized or out of work and wish for us to make other employees aware of your condition, you may notify us in writing and we will put your information on the company bulletin board. Otherwise, the Build Oahu prohibition on the disclosure of personal health information shall apply. No employee may make postings, send interoffice emails or circulate any information about the health status of another employee. . If you have questions or concerns about life-threatening illnesses, you should contact the Human Resources Department for information and referral to appropriate services and resources. . Back to the top . Immigration Law Compliance . Build Oahu will employ only United States citizens and those non-United States citizens who are authorized to work in the United States. We will comply with all aspects of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. Build Oahu will not discriminate on the basis of national origin or citizenship. . As a condition of employment, each new employee must complete the Employment Eligibility Verification Form I-9 and present documentation establishing identity and substantiating employment eligibility. . Former employees who are rehired must complete another Form I-9 if the previous I-9 with the Company is more than three years old, or if the original I-9 is not accurate anymore, or if we no longer have the original I-9. If you have questions or want information on the immigration laws, contact the Operations Manager, or the Owner. If you ask questions or want to complain about the immigration law, you will not be punished in any way. . Back to the top . Productive Work Environment . It is our goal to promote a productive work environment and not to tolerate verbal or physical conduct by any employee that harasses, disrupts, or interferes with another’s work performance or that creates an intimidating, offensive, or hostile environment. . Employees are expected to maintain a productive work environment that is free from harassing or disruptive activity. No form of harassment will be tolerated, including harassment for the following reasons: race, national origin, religion, disability, pregnancy, age, military status, or sex. Special attention should be paid to the prohibition of sexual harassment. . Each employee has a responsibility to keep the workplace free of any form of harassment, and in particular, sexual harassment. No employee is to threaten or insinuate, either explicitly or implicitly, that another employee’s refusal or willingness to submit to sexual advances will affect the employee’s terms or condition of employment. Other sexually harassing or offensive conduct in the workplace, whether committed by supervisors, managers, non‐supervisory employees, or non‐employees, is also prohibited. This conduct includes: . Unwanted physical contact or conduct of any kind, including sexual flirtations, touching, advances, or propositions; | Verbal harassment of a sexual nature, such as lewd comments, sexual jokes or references, and offensive personal reference; | Demeaning, insulting, intimidating, or sexually suggestive comments about an individual; | The display in the workplace of demeaning, insulting, intimidating, or sexually suggestive objects, pictures, or photographs; | Demeaning, insulting, intimidating, or sexually suggestive written, recorded, or electronically transmitted messages. | . Any of the above conduct, or other offensive conduct, directed at individuals because of their race, sex, national origin, religion, disability, pregnancy, age, or military status is prohibited. . Any employee who believes that a supervisor’s, other employee’s or non‐employee’s actions or words constitute unwelcome harassment has a responsibility to report or complain about the situation as soon as possible. The report or compliant should be made to the Supervisor or to the or next level supervisor or the company owner if the complaint involves the Supervisor. . Any complaint of harassment will be handled and investigated. All complaints of harassment will be investigated promptly and in as impartial and confidential a manner as possible. Employees are required to cooperate in any investigation. A timely resolution of each complaint should be reached and communicated to the parties involved. Any employee who is found to have violated the harassment policy will be subject to appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Management prohibits any form of retaliation against employees for bringing bona fide complaints or providing information about harassment. . Back to the top .",
