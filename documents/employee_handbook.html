We walk with our customers through each phase of the design, permit and construction process, because helping them when they need us creates less stress and leads to the high-quality homes they have always dreamed of.</p> <p><a href="#employee-handbook">Back to the top</a></p> <div style="page-break-after: always;"></div> <h2 id="employee-conduct-1"> <a href="#employee-conduct-1" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#link"></use></svg></a> Employee Conduct </h2> <h3 id="hours-of-operation"> <a href="#hours-of-operation" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#link"></use></svg></a> Hours of Operation </h3> <p>The normal hours of operation for all employees are from 7:30 am to 4:00 pm, Monday through Friday. We expect you to be at the jobsite or working as directed at the beginning of your shift and stay on the clock until the end of the workday or the end of your shift. In general, this requires that you arrive at the job site about 15 minutes early to park, unload any tools, get focused and be prepared to start work.</p> <p>Earlier or later hours may be required at times and there may be coordination calls that need to occur prior to or after your shift. The possibility of working overtime above scheduled hours (including weekend hours) will always be present and considered mandatory when the workload is excessive. For more information on overtime hours see the section of this handbook on <a href="#Overtime">overtime</a>.</p> <p><a href="#employee-handbook">Back to the top</a></p> <h3 id="attendance-and-punctuality"> <a href="#attendance-and-punctuality" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#link"></use></svg></a> Attendance and Punctuality </h3> <p>We expect Build Oahu employees to arrive at work before you are scheduled to start and be productively engaged in the company business by the scheduled start time. If you cannot come to work or you will be late, you must notify your Supervisor prior to your scheduled start time, unless in extenuating circumstances. You must request all time off in advance and submit it in writing, as outlined in this section and the section on <a href="#Leave">Leave</a>, except in the case of an unexpected illness.</p> <p>Unplanned absences can disrupt work, inconvenience other employees, and affect productivity. All unapproved absences will be noted in the employee’s personnel file. Excessive absences (including leaving work early) or tardiness, including for illness or personal reasons, will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination.</p> <p><a href="#employee-handbook">Back to the top</a></p> <h3 id="recording-your-time"> <a href="#recording-your-time" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#link"></use></svg></a> Recording Your Time </h3> <p>All Build Oahu employees are given a key fob they use to clock in and out of each job site using a system called TSheets. It is mandatory that you clock in and clock out of the specific jobsite where you are located, including clocking in and out for lunch. If you leave the facility or job site for non‐business reasons you must clock out. Failure to do any of the above will result in disciplinary action up to and including termination and possible discrepancies in the amount of your compensation.</p> <p><a href="#employee-handbook">Back to the top</a></p> <h3 id="customer-contact"> <a href="#customer-contact" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#link"></use></svg></a> Customer Contact </h3> <p>Treat all customers with utmost respect. Keep customer interactions brief, polite and professional. Avoid cursing or speaking loudly. Remember that we are working in our customers homes.

We provide each employee with 5 company shirts when hired. If an employee works for less than 6 months then he/she must return the shirts in good condition or a cost of 65 dollars will be taken from his/her last paycheck. There is no charge for employees who have worked for longer than 6 months.</p> <p>Unpleasant body odors which are a result of lack of hygience should be avoided and could result in dismissal because they affect an employees ability to interact with customers and co-workers in a professional manner.</p> <p><a href="#employee-handbook">Back to the top</a></p> <h3 id="tools"> <a href="#tools" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#link"></use></svg></a> Tools </h3> <p>Employees are expected to own the tools and equipment they use on a daily basis at a construction site.

There is a 60 day grace period for the employee to purchase the requisite items; however, if an employee is still borrowing tools and safety equipment from coworkers or their supervisor after 60 days then it may be considered an indication the employee is not able to fullfil the responsibilities of his/her position.</p> <p>Build Oahu will provide specialized equipment, such as table saw, chop saw, compressor and nail guns, chipping guns and grinders. We will also provide any unique, or specialized safety equipment in the event that a job requires more than the standard items listed above.</p> <h3 id="work-rules"> <a href="#work-rules" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#link"></use></svg></a> Work Rules </h3> <p>We expect you to follow certain work rules and conduct yourself in ways that protect the interests and safety of all employees and Build Oahu.</p> <p>These rules are published for your information and to minimize the likelihood of any employee, through misunderstanding or otherwise, to become subject to any disciplinary action.</p> <p>Violation of work rules such as these as well as other offenses deemed appropriate by management may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment:</p> <ul> <li>Theft or inappropriate removal or possession of property</li> <li>Falsification of timekeeping or other company records</li> <li>Working under the influence of alcohol or illegal drugs</li> <li>Possession, distribution, sale, transfer, or use of alcohol or illegal drugs in the workplace, while on duty, or while operating employer-owned vehicles or equipment</li> <li>Conviction of a felony</li> <li>Fighting or threatening violence in the workplace</li> <li>Boisterous or disruptive activity in the workplace</li> <li>Negligence or improper conduct leading to damage of employer-owned or customer-owned property</li> <li>Insubordination or other disrespectful conduct</li> <li>Sleeping during work hours</li> <li>Violation of safety or health rules</li> <li>Smoking in prohibited areas</li> <li>Sexual or other unlawful or unwelcome harassment</li> <li>Possession of dangerous or unauthorized materials, such as explosives or firearms, in the workplace</li> <li>Contributing to unsanitary conditions, poor housekeeping or eating at workstations</li> <li>Excessive absenteeism or any absence without notice</li> <li>Absence for three consecutive work days without notification (except in extenuating circumstances)</li> <li>Unauthorized absence from work during the workday</li> <li>Unauthorized use of telephones, mail system, or other employer-owned equipment</li> <li>Unauthorized disclosure of business “secrets” or confidential information</li> <li>Unauthorized presence on Company property outside of employee’s scheduled work hours</li> <li>Violation of personnel policies</li> <li>Unsatisfactory performance or conduct</li> </ul> <p>This list is an example only and is not all-inclusive.</p> <p>Since your employment with Build Oahu is voluntary and at will, you may terminate your employment at any time you want, with or without cause or advance notice.

Also, we may perform testing for additional reasons which include, but are not limited to pre-employment, suspicious behavior and/or random selection.</p> <p>If you violate this policy, it may lead to disciplinary action, up to and including immediate termination of your employment.

The pay period is weekly, meaning you will receive payment for one work week at a time. The pay date is the second Friday after the pay period ends. For example, the pay date of Friday October 25, 2019 covers the period of Friday October 11, 2019 through Thursday October 17, 2019. Payday is every Friday through direct deposit only. The pay date will not be adjusted for any reasons, to include scheduled vacations.</p> <p>Your pay statement will be emailed to you at the email address you provide, and will list your gross pay and itemized deductions for all time worked through the preceding payroll week.

On occasion, Build Oahu employees must work overtime in order to achieve the quality of work for our customers that reflects our mission and values. If directed, you are expected to work necessary overtime during these occasions. Full-time employees will receive time and one‐half pay for time worked exceeding 40 hours in any given workweek. Temporary employees do not receive overtime.</p> <p>There may be operations that require you to work at night. Work outside of normal work hours does not automatically qualify as overtime pay. If you are asked to work at night, but your total hours worked for that workweek is less than or equal to 40 hours you will not receive overtime pay.</p> <p>Your supervisor will inform you of the need to work overtime hours in a timely manner with as much lead time as possible.</p> <p><a href="#employee-handbook">Back to the top</a></p> <h3 id="rest-and-lunch-breaks"> <a href="#rest-and-lunch-breaks" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#link"></use></svg></a> Rest and Lunch Breaks </h3> <p>It is our policy to provide two 10‐minute rest breaks and a 30-minute lunch break during the course of each full workday. Usually you may take one break in the morning and one in the afternoon, but your supervisor may change the frequency and time of rest breaks if necessary. Time spent on your 10‐minute breaks will be compensated as working time. Normal break times are scheduled around 10:00 am and 3:00 pm.</p> <p>Normal lunch breaks are scheduled between the hours of 11:00 am – 2:00 pm. You will have 30 minutes for a lunch break each day. Since mealtime is not part of your working hours, you are not paid for it.</p> <p>Rest breaks and lunch breaks cannot be scheduled to accommodate appointments, late arrivals or early departures. You are expected to be punctual in starting and ending your breaks and lunch hours and may be disciplined for tardiness. If you choose to remain at work during your break, you are not entitled to arrive later than the scheduled starting time or leave before the normal quitting time and will not receive extra pay for the time worked.</p> <p><a href="#employee-handbook">Back to the top</a></p> <h3 id="health-insurance"> <a href="#health-insurance" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#link"></use></svg></a> Health Insurance </h3> <p>Build Oahu provides individual medical, dental and vision health care plans to all full-time employees at no additional cost to the employee.</p> <p>Health care eligibility begins after 30 days of employment of when the employee has worked an average of 20 or more hours per week.</p> <p>Extended health care coverage for family members and other dependents is available at additional costs to the employee.

The employee will send an email to James Kijek summarizing the injury/illness and how it happened. The subject of the email should say “Employee Injury/Illness Report”.</p> <p>James Kijek will:</p> <ul> <li>Determine from the Employee’s Report or any workers’ compensation claim form associated with the incident, whether it must be recorded on the OSHA Form 300 Log of Work-Related Injuries and Illnesses and Summary according to the instructions for that form.</li> <li>Enter a recordable incident onto OSHA Form 300 within seven days after the company becomes aware of it.</li> <li>Investigate recordable incidents using procedures in the <a href="#Incident-Investigation-Procedure">Incident Investigation Procedure</a> section below.</li> <li>If the injury is not recorded on the OSHA log, add it to the incident log, which is used to record non-OSHA recordable injuries and near misses.</li> <li>Each month at the scheduled safety committee meeting, make any new injury reports and investigations available for review, along with an updated OSHA and incident report log.</li> <li>Should multiple accidents occur at the workplace an analysis shall be done at least semi-annually to identify trends. i.e. back injuries, slips, trips, and falls, etc. Identification of the types, causes and nature of accidents and injuries occurring as well as which job tasks these accidents are occurring will help to focus on what area(s) need corrective action. In addition, the trend analysis shall be performed as a result of departmental, job site or other work areas where Hazard Recognition Survey/Inspections are performed. This will assist in identifying unsafe conditions and other hazardous situations that may be occurring on a consistent basis.</li> </ul> <p>At the end of each year, James Kijek will use OSHA Form 300 to complete OSHA Form 300a Summary of Work-Related Injuries and Illnesses. James Kijek will post a signed copy of the OSHA log summary for the previous year on the bulletin board at the shop each February 1 until April 30. OSHA Form 300’s will be kept on file for at least 5 years. Any employee can view an OSHA Form 300’s and 300a’s upon request at any time during the year.</p> <p>The following types of incidents must be reported to the Hawai’i Occupational Safety and Health Division (HIOSH) and must be recorded in OSHA Form 300:</p> <p>If an employee dies while working or is not expected to survive, when one (1) or more employee are admitted to a hospital as a result of a work-related incident, amputation and loss of an eye, James Kijek will contact HIOSH within 8 hours after becoming aware of the incident at 808-586-9102. Also, if an accident results in more than $25,000 in property damage James Kijek will contact the Hawai’i Occupational Safety and Health Division (HIOSH) within 8 hours after becoming aware of the incident.</p> <p>When an incident matching the criteria explained occurs, James Kijek must talk with a representative of HIOSH. During evenings and weekends, a message can be left on the answering machine. James Kijek must report: the employer name, location and time of the incident, number of employees involved, the extent of injuries or illness, a brief description of what happened and the name and phone number of a contact person. These types of incidents must also be recorded on Occupational Health and Safety (OSHA) form 300.</p> <p>The following types of incidents must be recorded on OSHA Form 300 but DO NOT NEED to be reported to the Hawai’i Occupational Safety and Health Division (HIOSH):</p> <p>Any work-related injury that results in a fatality, days away from work, job restriction or transfer, or medical treatment beyond first aid. Note that trips to the Emergency Room, or diagnostic procedures such as x-rays, do not automatically qualify as treatement beyond first aid. A medical treatment such as prescription medications, sutures, etc. would need to be provided in order to qualify.</p> <p>Any incident included in the OSHA form 300, or any injury that could have resulted in serious injury (near-miss) will be investigated using the <a href="#Incident-Investigation-Procedure">Incident Investigation Procedure</a> below.</p> <p><a href="#employee-handbook">Back to the top</a></p> <h3 id="incident-investigation-procedure"> <a href="#incident-investigation-procedure" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#link"></use></svg></a> Incident Investigation Procedure </h3> <p>Whenever there is an incident that requires HIOSH to be notified, a preliminary investigation will be conducted by the immediate supervisor of the injured person(s), James Kijek, and any other persons whose expertise would help the investigation.</p> <p>• DO NOT DISTURB the scene except to aid in rescue or make the scene safe.</p> <p>The investigation team will take written statements from witnesses, photograph the incident scene and equipment involved. The team will also document as soon as possible after the incident, the condition of equipment and any anything else in the work area that may be relevant. The team will make a written “Incident Investigation Report” of its findings. The report will include a sequence of events leading up to the incident, conclusions about the incident and any recommendations to prevent a similar incident in the future. The report will be reviewed by all employees at the next safety meeting.</p> <p>When James Kijek or a supervisor becomes aware of an employee injury which must be recorded in OSHA Form 300, but was not serious enough to require that HIOSH be notified, the supervisor will write a narrative summary of the incident, attempt to explain why the incident happened and provide recommendations to prevent a similar incident in the future. Then, the supervisor will paste in or attach the text to an email with the subject “Incident Investigation Report” and send the email to James Kijek. These reports and others will be kept in a folder titled “Incident Log”.</p> <p>Whenever there is an incident that did not but could have resulted in serious injury to an employee (a near-miss), the incident will be investigated by the supervisor or a team depending on the seriousness of the injury that would have occurred. The resulting report will be clearly marked to indicate that it was a near miss and that no actual injury occurred and the report will be to the Incident Log.</p> <p><a href="#employee-handbook">Back to the top</a></p> <h3 id="eliminating-workplace-hazards"> <a href="#eliminating-workplace-hazards" class="anchor-heading"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#link"></use></svg></a> Eliminating Workplace Hazards </h3> <p>Build Oahu is committed to eliminating or controlling workplace hazards that could cause injury or illness to our employees.

Therefore, please do not hesitate to discuss any aspect of your job with your supervisor. Communication is key. If you don’t know, then ask.
